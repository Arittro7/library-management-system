        Develop a minimal library management system using React, Redux Toolkit
        Query (RTK Query), and TypeScript. The system will allow users to view a
        list of books, perform CRUD operations, borrow books, and view a simple
        borrow summaryâ€”all without authentication, category filters, or payment
        integration. The main goal is to build a functional and clean
        client-side application that interacts with a RESTful API, demonstrating
        proper state management, UI design, and core functionality.
